This repository contains four files, two of which are Jupyter Notebooks while the other two are PDFs of the Notebooks showing the output.

Program:	Coding Companion for Intuitive Deep Learning Part 1 Annotated.ipynb
          Coding Companion to Intuitive Deep Learning Part 2 (Annotated).ipynb
Output: 	Coding Companion for Intuitive Deep Learning Part 1 Annotated.pdf
          Coding Companion to Intuitive Deep Learning Part 2 (Annotated).pdf

The Jupyter Notebooks are written by Joseph Lee Wei En, with some of my annotations in italics or some additional Python comments.
